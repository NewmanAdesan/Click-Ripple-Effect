# Click-Ripple-Effect
A Web Effect Project that shows how a click ripple effect can be designed.<br />
basically, at the point of the click, a 100px by 100px white element(span element) <br />
then over the time span of 0.5 seconds, two things happen simultaneously. <br />
- one, it is made to transition to a scale of three times its size <br />
- two, it is made to transition to an opacity of 0 i.e transparent <br />
After this, the element is removed.
<br />
One important thing that must be done is that the element that is clicked in this case the button element <br />
must have its overflow property set to hidden. this completes the visually appealing effect <br />
